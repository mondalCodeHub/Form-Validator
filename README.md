## Project Introduction

Form validation is a "technical process in which a web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct." The form will either alert the user that they messed up and must correct something before proceeding, or the form will be validated and the user will be able to continue with their registration process.

To create this validation form, I used HTML CSS and pure Javascript in this project.
## Technology used
